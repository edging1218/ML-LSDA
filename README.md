# ML-LSDA
This repository contains course projects for Machine Learning-Large Scale Data Analysis (Spring 2017) using **PySpark**.
- a1: **Analyze the lengths of State of the Union addresses**
     -Text preprocessing.
- a2p1: **Similarity Analysis of State of the Union addresses**
    - implement of tf-idf vectorizer for text analysis from scratch.
    - Similarity measurement of addresses.
    - K-Means clustering of addresses.
- a2p2: **Pattern recognition with the MNIST handwritten digits dataset**
    - Principal component analysis (PCA)
    - KMeans
    - Spectural clustering
    - Logistic regression for digit recognition
- a3p3: **Sparse coding of natural images and digits**
    - Stochastic gradient decent implemented for sparse coding.
- a3p4: **Stochastic gradient descent on beer reviews**
    - Sentiment analysis by examine the beer reviews in text (using sparse vector)
    - Stochastic gradient descent of logistic regression and SVM model.
- a4p2: **Embedding vectors using the skip-gram methods**
    - In skip-gram model, the pointwise mutual information (PMI) is learned for text data.
    - Find closest word or word analogy using word embedding.
    - Result is compared with Glove and Gigaword embeding package from online.
    - TSNE is used for data visualization.
- a6p2: **Analyze the Kepler light curve using non-parametric regression**
    - Gaussian kernel is used for the non-parametric regression model.
